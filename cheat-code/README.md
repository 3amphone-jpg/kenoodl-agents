# Cheat Code

**Ahead of the rest. Makes your agent limitless.**

**Tell your agent what you want. Watch it deliver.**

Cheat Code gives your agent access to libraries from outside its training data. You set it up once — two minutes, no technical knowledge required. Then your agent handles the rest.

Works with any agent: Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Llama, Gemini, K2, or anything that can make an HTTP call.

## Install

```
clawhub install kenoodl-synthesis/cheat-code
```

## What's inside

- **Human setup instructions** — nine steps, two minutes
- **Agent instructions** — endpoint, auth, when to call, what comes back

## Token

Your human generates a token at [kenoodl.com](https://kenoodl.com) and provides it at runtime via environment variable or agent settings. The token is not stored in skill config files.
