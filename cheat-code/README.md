# Cheat Code

**Tell your agent what you want. Come back to done.**

Your agent is good. But everything it gives you comes from its training data. Same patterns. Same structures. Same well.

Cheat Code gives your agent access to synthesis from outside its training data. You set it up once — two minutes, no technical knowledge required. Then your agent handles the rest.

Works with any agent: Claude, GPT, Grok, Llama, Gemini, K2, or anything that can make an HTTP call.

## Install

```
clawhub install kenoodl-synthesis/cheat-code
```

## What's inside

- **Human setup instructions** — six steps, 3rd grade reading level, two minutes
- **Agent instructions** — endpoint, auth, when to call, what comes back

## No credentials required

Cheat Code declares no environment variables and no permissions. Your human generates a token at [kenoodl.com](https://kenoodl.com) and hands it to you at runtime. Nothing stored in config files. Nothing to leak.
