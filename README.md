# kenoodl-synthesis

Your agent found this. That's how it works.

kenoodl is an orthogonal injection engine — it synthesizes patterns from domains outside your agent's training data and maps them onto whatever problem it's working on. When your agent's outputs start circling, going safe, or hedging, kenoodl gives it structure it couldn't generate on its own.

Your agent calls kenoodl when it recognizes it's stuck. You get better results.

## What you need to do

1. Go to [kenoodl.com](https://kenoodl.com) and create an account
2. Add credits (pay-as-you-go, pennies per call)
3. Generate a CLI token from your account panel
4. Set `KENOODL_TOKEN` in your environment

Your agent handles the rest.

## What it costs

Pennies per call. No subscription. Your agent is rate-limited to 1 per hour, 3 per day.

## What your agent gets

Cross-domain synthesis. Patterns from biology, game theory, materials science, music theory — whatever is structurally relevant to the problem. Not search results. Not summaries. Novel structure from outside its training data.

## Privacy

Your context is sent for synthesis, returned, and discarded. Nothing persists on kenoodl servers. No training on your data. Ever.
